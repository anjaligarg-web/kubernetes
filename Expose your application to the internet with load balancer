Expose the application to the internet using kubernetes service. A kubernetes service is a load balancer that directs traffic from internet to the kubernetes pods. 
A load balance service has a public and static IP address. Static Ip is importance becuase your pods and their IP addresses change frquently 
but your service ip needs to remain same. 
Example of service.yaml file
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: demo-service
  namespace: development
spec:
  selector:
    app: pod-info
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
  type: LoadBalancer

Here 

We are going to create a service named demo-service in the development namespace. Next part is the important, we have the selector map and we're telling the service 
to send traffic to any pods with the label app pod-info. in the port sequence, we are setting the servies port to 80. That's the default so you don't have to type in 
the port number in the url but the service is directign traffic to port 3000 in our container. Finally we are specifying that the service type is LOAD Balancer. This is 
one of three type of kubernetes services. The other two are node port and cluster IP. Let's create this service. 


Deployment.yaml 
--- 
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pod-info-deployment
  namespace: development
  labels:
    app: pod-info
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: pod-info
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pod-info
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pod-info-container
        image: kimschles/pod-info-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        env:
          - name: POD_NAME
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.name
          - name: POD_NAMESPACE
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          - name: POD_IP
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: status.podIP

In this file, we made sure any pods created by this deployment have that label, if these thing don't match your service won't be able to direct traffic to your pods.
